# Lachesis Consensus Protocol

## Abstract

The lachesis consensus protocol allows a group of distributed participants to agree upon the occurence and ordering of events. The particpants must know each other and agree upon the total number of participants in the network.

## Event Block

An event block consists of:

1. Payload: the payload data 
2. Self-Parent-Hash: the SHA3-256 hash of an event published by another participant
3. Other-Parent-Hash: the SHA3-256 hash of previous event published by the participant
4. Event-Hash: the SHA3-256 hash generated by signing 1, 2 and 3 with the participants private key 
5. Particpant-ID: the public key associated with the particpants private key

## Determining occurence of events

## DAG

Events blocks form a directed acyclic graph. Participants publish events on the network which are appended to the event DAG. The root event block is the first event block to connect 2/3 of the event blocks since the last root event block. 

## Communicating with Other Participants

Participants in the lachesis network communicate by sharing event blocks with each other over gRPC. Participants create event blocks and send them to other participants in the  


## Event Finality

Event blocks form a directed acyclic graph. When an event connects 2/3 of the other events in the event DAG it becomes a root 
Events are finalised when they are become part of the 2/3 supermajority of the Event DAG.
